Hibernate

This is a topic I'm newly learning. I haven't used this concept before in programs 
so I wanted to get familiar with the concept at the beginning of the semester so 
I would be more effective with it when we’re into programming our app. It was pretty 
intimidating at first because I could see that this was a huge subject and had lots 
of components to it. After reading several articles on the subject some from the 
Topics and Resources provided and some from example on the internet, I got my head
wrapped around what its purpose was and how to use it. 

Hibernate helps java be object relational and maps Java classes to database tables. 
It bridges the gap between Java objects and the database server pushing those 
objects based on the relational maps you create.
Advantages of using Hibernate:

•	Provides simple APIs for storing and retrieving Java objects directly to 
        and from the database.
•	Hibernate does not require an application server to operate.
•	Manipulates Complex associations of objects of your database.
•	Provides simple querying of data.

I have a working example of the code in my repository here:

I also wrote my own code to gather objects and create a table to store them here:

I presented my topic and taught my team
